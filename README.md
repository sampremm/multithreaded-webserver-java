Here's a basic `README.md` for your **Multithreaded Web Server** using a **Thread Pool**:

# Multithreaded Web Server with Thread Pool

This project implements a **multithreaded web server** that uses a **fixed-size thread pool** to handle multiple client connections concurrently. The server listens on a specified port and handles client requests using threads from the thread pool to improve efficiency and scalability.

## Features

- **Thread Pooling**: The server uses a fixed-size thread pool to handle incoming client requests, allowing multiple clients to be served concurrently without creating a new thread for each connection.
- **Socket Communication**: The server and clients communicate over TCP sockets.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The server supports a graceful shutdown by shutting down the thread pool once the server stops accepting new connections.
- **Customizable Thread Pool Size**: You can specify the number of threads in the pool to control concurrency based on the expected traffic.

## Requirements

- **Java 8 or higher** is required to run the server and client programs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Install **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher.
- Set up a Java development environment (IDE or command line).

### Running the Server

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Compile the `Server.java` class.
3. Run the server with the following command:
   ```bash
   java Server
   ```
   The server will start listening on port `8010`. You can adjust the port in the code.

### Running the Client

1. Compile the `Client.java` class.
2. Run the client with the following command:
   ```bash
   java Client
   ```
   The client will connect to the server, send a message, and receive a response.

### Thread Pool Configuration

- The thread pool size is set to **10** by default in the server. You can change this value by modifying the `poolSize` variable in the `Server.java` file.
  
### Example Output

#### Server Output:
```
Server is listening on port 8010
Connected to /127.0.0.1:xxxx
Hello from server /127.0.0.1
```

#### Client Output:
```
Hello from server /127.0.0.1
```

## How It Works

1. **Server**:
   - The server listens on port `8010`.
   - When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and passes it to the thread pool for handling.
   - Each worker thread in the pool sends a greeting message to the client.
   - The server continues to accept new client connections until it is manually stopped.

2. **Client**:
   - The client connects to the server, sends a message ("Hello World from socket"), and waits for a response from the server.
   - Once the server sends a response, the client closes the connection.

## Code Explanation

- **Server.java**:
   - A `ServerSocket` is created to listen for incoming connections on port `8010`.
   - A fixed-size thread pool (`ExecutorService`) is used to manage the worker threads.
   - For each client connection, the server assigns a thread from the pool to handle the communication.

- **Client.java**:
   - The client creates a socket connection to the server, sends a message, and receives the response.

## Benefits of Using a Thread Pool

- **Efficiency**: Reuses threads instead of creating new ones for each request, saving system resources.
- **Concurrency**: Can handle multiple clients concurrently, improving the server's throughput and responsiveness.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale the server by adjusting the size of the thread pool to handle more clients.
